#Problem Statement- It has been a problem in India since a very long time that the farmers/agriculturists have not been able to cultivate crops which would be more profitable to them since they donâ€™t analyze various factor upon which the profits for their crops would increase or decrease. Due to this, the agriculturists are not able to use their land and time judiciously. This also creates shortages of various crops since most agriculturists grow the same type of crops, creating a surplus of the crops of the same type and creating a shortage of other crops which leads to increase in dependence of foreign trade, decreasing the balance of trade.

Aim- The aim of this projects is to create a mobile app/system which helps determine which crop should be cultivated according to various factors including: reserve stocks, climatic conditions, exports, location, etc. Such an app/program would go a long way in strengthening the Indian economy.

# 1. The code of the project will take various economic and climatic datasets related to agriculture and give an output about which crop should be cultivated.

# 2. To provide variance in the types of crops the agriculturists, the program will take into considerations different varieties of crops and give the agriculturists results based on the area of land they have, tools and modern machinery available and manpower. This would result in better results in the cultivation.

# 3. The economic factors the program will consider are:

  a. Exports and imports of a particular crop: If the imports of a crop are high then that 		particular crop will be recommended to cultivate more. The crop with more exports will be 	encouraged to be cultivated in the areas which provide better yield for that.

  b. Surplus Stock: If there is shortage of a particular crop, then that crop should be grown, for 	example there is a surplus stock of wheat, then other cereals like bajra and oats should be 	grown.
  c. Price of the crop: If the price of a type of crop has increased, then this means there is more 	need than production of this crop, then this would call for increase in its production.
